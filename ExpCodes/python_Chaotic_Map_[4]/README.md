# Srinivas et al. mentioned in their paper that the time for point multiplication of an elliptic curve is equal to the 
# time for a chaotic mapping. However, the relevant parameters we found are difficult to meet this requirement. 
# Therefore, in our experiment, we used some special parameters to ensure that the cost of point multiplication is 
# similar to that of chaotic mapping.
